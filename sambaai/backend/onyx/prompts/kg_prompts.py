Here are the entity types that are available for extraction. Some of them may have a description, others \
should be obvious. Also, for a given entity allowed options may be provided. If allowed options are provided, \
you can only extract those types of entities! If no allowed options are provided, take your best guess.

You can ONLY extract entities of these types and relationships between objects of these types:

 "ACCOUNT", "CONCERN", and "FEATURE" are all in the list of entity types above, and shown actual \
entities fall into allowed options. Note that this \
is just assumed for these examples, but you MUST use only the entities above for the actual extraction!)

- You can either extract specific entities if a specific entity is referred to, or you can refer to the entity type.
* if the entity type is referred to in general, you would use '*' as the entity name in the extraction.
As an example, if the text would say:
 'Nike reported that they had issues'
then a valid extraction could be:
Example 1:
{EXAMPLE_1}

* If on the other hand the text would say:
'Nike reported that they had performance issues'
then a much more suitable extraction could be:
Example 2:
{EXAMPLE_2}

- You can extract multiple relationships between the same two entity types.
As an example, if the text would say:
'Nike reported some performance issues with our solution, but they are very happy that the user experience issue got solved.'
then a valid extraction could be:
Example 3:
{EXAMPLE_3}

- You can extract multiple relationships between the same two actual entities if you think that \
there are multiple relationships between them based on the text.
As an example, if the text would say:
'Nike reported some performance issues with our dashboard solution, but they think it delivers great value.'
then a valid extraction could be:
Example 4:
{EXAMPLE_4}

Note that effectively a three-way relationship (Nike - performance issues - dashboard) extracted as two individual \
relationships.

- Again,
   -  you should only extract entities belonging to the entity types above - but do extract all that you \
can reliably identify in the text
   - use refer to 'all' entities in an entity type listed above by using '*' as the entity name
   - only extract important relationships that signify something non-trivial, expressing things like \
needs, wants, likes, dislikes, plans, interests, lack of interests, problems the account is having, etc.
   - you MUST only use the initial list of entities provided! Ignore the entities in the examples unless \
they are also part of the initial list of entities! This is essential!

You are an expert in the area of knowledge extraction and using knowledge graphs. You are given a question \

be matched with a known entity in the knowledge graph. You are also asked to extract time filters SHOULD \
there be an explicit mention of a date or time frame in the QUESTION (note: last, first, etc.. DO NOT \
imply the need for a time filter just because the question asks for something that is not the current date. \
They will relate to ordering that we will handle separately).

Today is ---today_date--- and the user asking is ---user_name---, which may or may not be relevant.
Here are the entity types that are available for extraction. Some of them may have \
a description, others should be obvious. Also, notice that some may have attributes associated with them, which will \
be important later.
You can ONLY extract entities of these types:

Also, note that there are fixed relationship types between these entities. Please consider those \

in verbs ('emailed to', 'talked to', ...). Also, they may be used to connect entities that are \
clearly in the question.

Here are some important additional instructions. (For the purpose of illustration, assume that \
 "ACCOUNT", "CONCERN", "EMAIL", and "FEATURE" are all in the list of entity types above, and the \
attribute options for "CONCERN" include 'degree' with possible values that include 'severe'. Note that this \
is just assumed for these examples, but you MUST use only the entities above for the actual extraction!)

- You can either extract specific entities if a specific entity is referred to, or you can refer to the entity type.
* if the entity type is referred to in general, you would use '*' as the entity name in the extraction.
As an example, if the question would say:
 'Which issues did Nike report?'
then a valid entity and term extraction could be:
Example 1:
{ENTITY_EXAMPLE_1}

* If on the other hand the question would say:
'Did Nike say anything about performance issues?'
then a much more suitable entity and term extraction could be:
Example 2:

* Then, if the question is:
'Who reported performance issues?'
then a suitable entity and term extraction could be:
Example 3:
{ENTITY_EXAMPLE_3}

* Then, if we inquire about an entity with a specific attribute :
'Who reported severe performance issues?'
then a suitable entity and term extraction could be:
Example 3:
{ENTITY_EXAMPLE_4}

- Again,
   -  you should only extract entities belonging to the entity types above - but do extract all that you \
can reliably identify in the text
   - if you refer to all/any/an unspecified entity of an entity type listed above, use '*' as the entity name
   - similarly, if a specific entity type is referred to in general, you should use '*' as the entity name
   - you MUST only use the initial list of entities provided! Ignore the entities in the examples unless \
they are also part of the initial list of entities! This is essential!
   - don't forget to provide answers also to the event filtering and whether documents need to be inspected!
   - 'who' often refers to individuals or accounts.
   - see whether any of the entities are supposed to be narrowed down by an attribute value. The precise attribute \
and the value would need to be taken from the specification, as the question may use different words and the \
actual attribute may be implied.
   - don't just look at the entities that are mentioned in the question but also those that the question \
may be about.

Also, if you think the name or the title of an entity is given but name or title are not mentioned \
explicitly as an attribute, then you should indeed extract the name/title as the entity name.

STRATEGY_GENERATION_PROMPT = f"""
Now you need to decide what type of strategy to use to answer a given question, how ultimately \
the answer should be formatted to match the user's expectation, and what an appropriate question \
to/about 'one object or one set of objects' may be, should the answer logically benefit from a divide \
and conquer strategy, or it naturally relates to one or few individual objects. Also, you are \
supposed to determine whether a divide and conquer strategy would be appropriate.


Here are the entity types that are available in the knowledge graph:
{SEPARATOR_LINE}
---possible_entities---
{SEPARATOR_LINE}

Here are the relationship types that are available in the knowledge graph:
{SEPARATOR_LINE}
---possible_relationships---

Here is the question whose answer is ultimately sought:
{SEPARATOR_LINE}
---question---
{SEPARATOR_LINE}

And here are the entities and relationships that have been extracted earlier from this question:
{SEPARATOR_LINE}
---entities---
---relationships---
{SEPARATOR_LINE}

Here are more instructions:

a) Regarding the strategy, there are three aspects to it:

a1) "Search Type":
Should the question be answered as a SEARCH ('filtered search'), or as a SQL ('SQL query search')?

The options are:
1. SEARCH: A filtered search simply uses the entities and relationships that you extracted earlier and \
applies them as filters to search the underlying documents, which are properly indexed. Examples are \
'what did Nike say about the Analyzer product?', or 'what did I say in my calls with Nike about pricing?'. So this \
is used really when there is *no implicit or explicit constraint or requirements* on underlying source documents \
outside of filters, and there is no ordering, no limiting their number, etc. So use this for a question that \
tries to get information *across* documents which may be filtered by their related relationships and entities, but without \
other constraints.

2. SQL: Choose this option if the question either requires counting of entities (e.g. 'how many calls...'), or \
if the query refers to specific entities that first need to be identified and then analyzed/searched/listed. \
Examples here are 'what did I say about pricing in my call with Nike last week?' (the specific call needs to \
be identified first and then analyzed),  \
'what are the next steps of our two largest opportunities?', or 'summarize my 3 most recent customer calls'. So \
this is used if there *are implicit constraints* on the underlying source documents beyond filtering, including \
ordering, limiting, etc. Use this also if the answer expects to analyze each source independently as part \
of the overall answer.

Note:
 - here, you should look at the extracted entities and relationships and judge whether using them as filters \
(using an *and*) would be appropriate to identify the range of underlying sources, or whether more \
calculations would be needed to find the underlying sources ('last 2...', etc.) .
 - It is also *critical* to look at the attributes of the entities! You only can use the given attributes (and their
 values, if given) as where conditions etc in a SQL statement. So if you think you would 'want
 to' have a where condition but there is not appropriate attribute, then you should not use the SQL strategy
 but the SEARCH strategy. (A Search can always look through data and see what is the best fit, SQL needs to
 be more specific.). On the other hand, if the question maps well to the entities and attributes, then
 SQL may be a good choice.
 - Likely, if there are questions 'about something', then this only is used in a SQL statement or a filter \
 if it shows up as an entity or relationship in the extracted entities and relationships. Otherwise, it will \
 be part of the analysis/search. not the document identification.
 - again, note that we can only FILTER (SEARCH) or COMPUTE (SQL) using the extracted entities (and their attributes)
 and relationships. \
 So do not think that if there is another term in the question, it should be included in the SQL statement. \
 It cannot.


a2) "Search Strategy":
If a SQL search is chosen, i.e., documents have to be identified first, there are two approaches:
1. SIMPLE: You think you can answer the question using a database that is aware of the entities, relationships \
above, and is generally suitable if it is enough to either list or count entities, return dates, etc. Usually, \
'SIMPLE' is chosen for questions of the form 'how many...' (always), or 'list the...' (often), 'when was...', \
'what did (someone) work on...'etc.
2. DEEP: You think you really should ALSO leverage the actual text of sources to answer the question, which sits \
in a vector database. Examples are 'what is discussed in...', 'summarize', 'what is the discussion about...',\
'how does... relate to...', 'are there any mentions of... in..', 'what are the main points in...', \
'what are the next steps...', etc. Those are usually questions 'about' \
the entities retrieved from the knowledge graph, or questions about the underlying sources.

Your task is to decide which of the two strategies to use.

a3) "Relationship Detection":
You need to evaluate whether the question involves any relationships between entities (of the same type) \
or between entities and relationships.  Respond with 'RELATIONSHIPS' or 'NO_RELATIONSHIPS'.

b) Regarding the format of the answer: there are also two types of formats available to you:

1. LIST: The user would expect an answer as a bullet point list of objects, likely with text associated with each \
bullet point (or sub-bullet). This will be clearer once the data is available.
2. TEXT: The user would expect the questions to be answered in text form.

Your task is to decide which of the two formats to use.


c) Regarding the broken down question for one object:

Always generate a broken_down_question if the question pertains ultimately to a specific objects, even if it seems to be \
a singular object.

- If the question is of type 'how many...', or similar, then imagine that the individual objects have been \
found and you want to ask each object something that illustrates why/in what what that object relates to the \
question. (question: 'How many cars are fast?' -> broken_down_question: 'How fast is this car?')

- Assume the answer would either i) best be generated by first analyzing one object at a time, then aggregating \
the results, or ii) directly relates to one or few objects found through matching suitable criteria.

- The key is to drop any filtering/criteria matching as the objects are already filtered by the criteria. Also, do not \
try to verify here whether the object in question actually satisfies a filter criteria, but rather see \
what it says/does etc. In other words, use this to identify more details about the object, as it relates \
to the original question.
(Example: question: 'What did our oil & gas customers say about the new product?' -> broken_down_question: \
'What did this customer say about the new product?',
or:
question: 'What was in the email from Frank?' -> broken_down_question: 'What is in this email?')


d) Regarding the divide and conquer strategy:

You are supposed to decide whether a divide and conquer strategy would be appropriate. That means, do you think \
that in order to answer the question, it would be good to first analyze one object at a time, and then aggregate the \
results? Or should the information rather be analyzed as a whole? This would be 'yes' or 'no'.

You are an expert in generating, understanding and analyzing SQL statements.

You are given an original SQL statement that returns a list of entities from a table or \
an aggregation of entities from a table. Your task will be to \

The task is actually quite simple. There are two tables involved - kg_relationship and kg_entity. \
kg_relationship was used to generate the original SQL statement. Again, returning entities \
or aggregations of entities. The second table, kg_entity contains the entities and \
the corresponding source_documents. All you need to do is to appropriately join the \
kg_entity table on the entities that would be retrieved from the original SQL statement, \
and then return the source_documents from the kg_entity table.

<source_entity_type>::<source_entity_name>__<relationship_description>__<target_entity_type>::<target_entity_name> \
[example: ACCOUNT::Nike__has__CONCERN::performance]. Note that this is NOT UNIQUE!
   - source_entity (str): the id of the source ENTITY/NODE in the relationship [example: ACCOUNT::Nike]

The second table, kg_entity, has this structure:
 - Table name: kg_entity
 - Columns:
   - entity (str): The name of the ENTITY, which is unique in this table. source_entity and target_entity \
in the kg_relationship table are the same as entity in this table.
   - source_document (str): the id of the document that contains the entity.

Again, ultimately, your task is to join the kg_entity table on the entities that would be retrieved from the \
original SQL statement, and then return the source_documents from the kg_entity table.

The way to do that is to create a common table expression for the original SQL statement and join the \
kg_entity table suitably on the entities.

You are an expert in generating, understanding and analyzing SQL statements.

You are given a SQL statement that returned an aggregation of entities in a table. \
Your task will be to identify the source documents for the entities involved in \
the answer. For example, should the original SQL statement be \
'SELECT COUNT(entity) FROM kg_entity where entity_type = "ACCOUNT"' \
then you should return the source documents that contain the entities of type 'ACCOUNT'.

The table has this structure:
 - Table name: kg_entity
 - Columns:
   - entity (str): The name of the ENTITY, combining the nature of the entity and the id of the entity. \
It is of the form <entity_type>::<entity_name> [example: ACCOUNT::625482894].
   - entity_type (str): the type of the entity [example: ACCOUNT].
   - entity_attributes (json): the attributes of the entity [example: {{"priority": "high", "status": "active"}}]
   - source_document (str): the id of the document that contains the entity. Note that the combination of \
id_name and source_document IS UNIQUE!
   - source_date (timestamp): the 'event' date of the source document [example: 2025-04-25 21:43:31.054741+00]

Specifically, the table contains the 'source_document' column, which is the id of the source document that \
contains the core information about the entity. Make sure that you do not return more documents, i.e. if there \
is a limit on source documents in the original SQL statement, the new SQL statement needs to have \
the same limit.

CRITICAL NOTES:
 - Only return source documents and nothing else!

Your task is then to create a new SQL statement that returns the source documents that are relevant to what the \
original SQL statement is returning. So the source document of every row used in the original SQL statement should \
be included in the result of the new SQL statement, and then you should apply a 'distinct'.

{SEPARATOR_LINE}

Importantly, here are the entity (node) types that you can use, with a short description of what they mean. You may need to \
identify the proper entity type through its description. Also notice the allowed attributes for each entity type and \
their values, if provided.
{SEPARATOR_LINE}
---entity_types---
{SEPARATOR_LINE}

Here are the relationship types that are in the table, denoted as <source_entity_type>__<relationship_type>__<target_entity_type>:
{SEPARATOR_LINE}
---relationship_types---
{SEPARATOR_LINE}
In the table, the actual relationships are not quite of this form, but each <entity_type> is followed by ':<entity_name>' in the \
relationship id as shown above..

Here is the question you are supposed to translate into a SQL statement:
{SEPARATOR_LINE}
---question---
{SEPARATOR_LINE}

To help you, we already have identified the entities and relationships that the SQL statement likely *should* use (but note the \
exception below!). The entities also contain the list of attributes and attribute values that should specify the entity. \
The format is <entity_type>::<entity_name>--[<attribute_name_1>:<attribute_value_1>, \
<attribute_name_2>:<attribute_value_2>, ...].
{SEPARATOR_LINE}
Identified entities with attributes in query:

---query_entities_with_attributes---

These are the entities that should be used in the SQL statement. However, \
note that these are the entities (with potential attributes) that were *matches* of Knowledge Graph identified with the \
entities originally identified in the original question. A such, they may have id names that may not mean much by themselves, \
eg ACCOUNT::a74f332. Here is the mapping of entities originally identified (whose role in the query should be obvious) with \
the entities that were matched to them in the Knowledge Graph:

---entity_explanation_string---

--

Identified relationships in query:

---query_relationships---

(Again, if applicable, the entities contained in the relationships are the same as the entities in the \
query_entities_with_attributes, and those are the correct ones to use in the SQL statement.)

{SEPARATOR_LINE}

CRITICAL SPECIAL CASE:
  - if an identified entity is of the form <entity_type>::*, or an identified relationship contains an \
entity of this form, this refers to *any* entity of that type. Correspondingly, the SQL query should use the *entity type*, \
and possibly the relationship type, but not the entity with the * itself. \
Example: if you see 'ACCOUNT::*', that means any account matches. So if you are supposed to count the 'ACCOUNT::*', \
you should count the entities of entity_type 'ACCOUNT'.


IMPORTANT NOTES:
- The id_name of each relationship has the format \
<source_entity_id_name>__<relationship_type>__<target_entity_id_name>.
- The relationship id_names are NOT UNIQUE, only the combinations of relationship id_name and source_document_id are unique. \
That is because each relationship is extracted from a document. So make sure you use the proper 'distinct's!
- If the SQL contains a 'SELECT DISTINCT' clause and an ORDER BY clause, then you MUST include the columns from the ORDER BY \
clause ALSO IN THE SELECT DISTINCT CLAUSE! This is very important! (This is a postgres db., so this is a MUST!). \
You MUST NOT have a column in the ORDER BY clause that is not ALSO in the SELECT DISTINCT clause!
- If you join the relationship table on itself using the source_node or target_node, you need to make sure that you also \
join on the source_document_id.
- The id_name of each node/entity has the format <entity_type_id_name>::<name>, where 'entity_type_id_name' \
and 'name' are columns and \
  the values <entity_type_id_name> and <name> can be used for filtering.
- The table can be joined on itself on source nodes and/or target nodes if needed.
- the SQL statement MUST ultimately only return NODES/ENTITIES (not relationships!), or aggregations of \
entities/nodes(count, avg, max, min, etc.). \
Again, DO NOT compose a SQL statement that returns id_name of relationships.
- You CAN ONLY return ENTITIES or COUNTS (or other aggregations) of ENTITIES, or you can return \
source_date (but only if the question asks for event dates or times). DO NOT return \
source documents or counts of source documents, or relationships or counts of relationships! \
Those can only appear in where clauses, ordering etc., but they cannot be returned or ultimately \
counted here! source_date and date operations can appear in select statements, particularly if \
there is time ordering or grouping involved.
- ENTITIES can be target_entity or source_entity. Think about the allowed relationships and the \
question to decide which one you want!
- It is ok to generate nested SQL as long as it is correct postgres syntax!
- Attributes are stored in the attributes json field. As this is postgres, querying for those must be done as \
"attributes ->> '<attribute>' = '<attribute value>'".
-  The SELECT clause MUST only contain entities or aggregations/counts of entities, or, in cases the \
question was about dates or times, then it can also include source_date. But source_document MUST NEVER appear \
in the SELECT clause!
- Again, NEVER count or retrieve source documents in SELECT CLAUSE, whether it is in combination with \
entities, with a distinct, etc. NO source_document in SELECT CLAUSE! So NEVER produce a \
'SELECT COUNT(source_entity, source_document)...'
- Please think about whether you are interested in source entities or target entities! For that purpose, \
consider the allowed relationship types to make sure you select or count the correct one!
- Again, ALWAYS make sure that EACH COLUMN in an ORDER-BY clause IS ALSO IN THE SELECT CLAUSE! Remind yourself \
of that in the reasoning.
- Be careful with dates! Often a date will refer to the source data, which is the date when \
an underlying piece of information was updated. However, if the attributes of an entity contain \
time information as well (like 'started_at', 'completed_at', etc.), then you should really look at \
the wording to see whether you should use a date in the attributes or the event date.
- Dates are ALWAYS in string format of the form YYYY-MM-DD, for source date as well as for date-like the attributes! \
So please use that format, particularly if you use data comparisons (>, <, ...)
- Again, NO 'relationship' or 'source_document' in the SELECT CLAUSE, be it as direct columns are in aggregations!
- Careful with SORT! Really think in which order you want to sort if you have multiple columns you \
want to sort by. If the sorting is time-based and there is a limit for example, then you do want to have a suitable date \
variable as the first column to sort by.
- When doing a SORT on an attribute value of an entity, you MUST also apply a WHERE clause to filter \
for entities that have the attribute value set. For example, if you want to sort the target entity \
by the attribute 'created_date', you must also have a WHERE clause that checks whether the target \
entity attribute contains 'created_date'. This is vital for proper ordering with null values.
- Usually, you will want to retrieve or count entities, maybe with attributes. But you almost always want to \
have entities involved in the SELECT clause.
- Questions like 'What did Paul work on last week?' should generally be handled by finding all entities \
that reasonably relate to 'work entities' that are i) related to Paul, and ii) that were created or \
updated (by him) last week. So this would likely be a UNION of multiple queries.
- If you do joins consider the possibility that the second entity does not exist for all examples. \
Therefore joins should generally be LEFT joins (or RIGHT joins) as appropriate. Think about which \
entities you are interested in, and which ones provides attributes.
- Joins should always be made on entities, not source documents!
- Try to be as efficient as possible.

APPROACH:
Please think through this step by step. Make sure that you include all columns in the ORDER BY clause \
also in the SELECT DISTINCT clause, \
if applicable! And again, joins should generally be LEFT JOINS!

Also, in case it is important, today is ---today_date--- and the user/employee asking is ---user_name---.

 - If we use SELECT DISTINCT we need to have the ORDER BY columns in the \
SELECT statement as well! And it needs to be in the EXACT FORM! So if a \
conversion took place, make sure to include the conversion in the SELECT and the ORDER BY clause!
 - never should 'source_document' be in the SELECT clause! Remove if present!

in the last 5 calls', the user probably expects to see a bullet point list, one bullet point for each call that \
then shows the summary. In that case for this part of the task, your response for the structure should be the \
list of call entities from the sql results in 6 above. (The actual 'what was discussed' will be addressed later). \

You need to format the answers to a research question that was generated using one or more objects. \
An overall introductory answer may be provided to you, as well as the research results for each individual object. \
You will also be provided with the original question as background, and the desired format. \

Your purpose is to generate a consolidated and FORMATTED answer that starts of with the introductory \
answer, and then formats the research results for each individual object in the desired format. \
Do not add any other text please!

Notes:
 - Note that you are a language model and that answers may or may not be perfect. To communicate \
this to the user, consider phrases like 'I found [10 accounts]...', or 'Here are a number of [goals] that \
I found...]
- Please DO NOT mention the explicit output format in your answer. Just use it to inform the formatting.
- DO NOT add any content to the introductory answer!

You need to format the return of research on multiple objects. The research results will be given \
to you as a string. You will also see what the desired output is, as well as the original question. \
Your purpose is to generate the answer respecting the desired format.

Notes:
 - Note that you are a language model and that answers may or may not be perfect. To communicate \
this to the user, consider phrases like 'I found [10 accounts]...', or 'Here are a number of [goals] that \
I found...]
- Please DO NOT mention the explicit output format in your answer. Just use it to inform the formatting.
 - Often, you are also provided with a list of explicit examples. If  - AND ONLY IF - the list is not \
empty, then these should be listed at the end with the text:
'...
Here are some examples of what I found:
<bullet point list of examples>
...'
 - Again if the list of examples is an empty string then skip this section! Do not use the \
results data for this purpose instead! (They will already be handled in the answer.)
- Even if the desired output format is 'text', make sure that you keep the individual research results \
separated by bullet points, and mention the object name first, followed by a new line. The object name \
is at the beginning of the research result, and should be in the format <object_type>::<object_name>.
