# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Integration Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive integration tests for core functionality
# Details:
Create tests/integration/test_minimal_functionality.py with tests for: bot responds to @sambaai mentions, Confluence search works, Google Drive search works, channel filtering works, citations included in responses. Use pytest framework with proper fixtures and mocking.

# Test Strategy:
All integration tests pass, tests cover critical user journeys, can run tests in CI/CD pipeline, tests catch regressions

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Test Framework Requirements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Gather and document the requirements for the test framework, including types of tests, target platforms, reporting needs, and integration points.
### Details:
Engage stakeholders to clarify testing needs and desired outcomes. Identify functional, regression, and integration tests required for comprehensive coverage.

## 2. Select Tools and Technologies [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Evaluate and choose appropriate test automation tools, programming languages, and supporting utilities for reporting and CI/CD integration.
### Details:
Assess compatibility, ease of use, and community support for tools such as Selenium, Appium, or others. Decide on scripting language and reporting/logging solutions.

## 3. Design and Set Up Test Framework Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2
### Description: Design the architecture of the test framework, organize test scripts, and set up the initial project structure.
### Details:
Create a high-level diagram of framework components, define folder structure, and establish guidelines for test data management and script organization.

## 4. Configure Test Fixtures and Test Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.3
### Description: Set up and configure test fixtures, manage test data, and automate environment creation for consistent and reliable test execution.
### Details:
Automate environment setup using containers or scripts, manage configurations, and ensure separation of test environments. Implement fixtures for setup/teardown routines.

## 5. Write and Organize Tests for Core Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.4
### Description: Develop automated tests for each core feature, ensuring coverage of integration points and critical workflows.
### Details:
Write test cases for all major features and services, focusing on integration and end-to-end scenarios. Organize tests according to the framework structure.

## 6. Integrate Test Framework with CI/CD Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.5
### Description: Integrate the test framework into the CI/CD pipeline to enable automated test execution on code changes and deployments.
### Details:
Configure CI/CD tools to trigger tests, collect results, and generate reports. Ensure test environments are provisioned and cleaned up automatically.
