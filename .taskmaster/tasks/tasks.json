The script automatically creates an OpenAI provider whenever GEN_AI_API_KEY is present, regardless of the actual model specified in the configuration. This conflicts with our Claude model configuration (claude-opus-4-20250514, claude-3-haiku-20240307) in the .env file, causing the API server to fail when attempting to use Claude API keys with an OpenAI provider.\n\nThe solution requires modifying setup.py to detect Claude model names in the configuration and create an Anthropic provider instead of defaulting to OpenAI. This modification will enable proper support for Claude models and resolve the provider mismatch issue.\n</info added on 2025-06-20T19:11:52.243Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-20T19:15:48.409Z>\nThe LLM configuration infrastructure has been successfully fixed. The setup.py file was modified to properly detect Claude models (claude-opus-4-20250514, claude-3-haiku-20240307) and create an Anthropic provider via LiteLLM instead of defaulting to OpenAI. The provider detection logic now correctly distinguishes between OpenAI and Anthropic models based on the model names in the configuration. The GEN_AI_API_KEY has been added to the .env file to trigger the auto-setup detection. With these changes, the API server now starts without the previous provider mismatch crashes, confirming that the core LLM provider setup is functioning correctly.
