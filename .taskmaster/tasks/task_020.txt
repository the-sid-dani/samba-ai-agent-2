# Task ID: 20
# Title: Test Channel-Specific Document Filtering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Verify that channel mappings correctly filter search results
# Details:
Test queries in different Slack channels to ensure proper document filtering. Verify #engineering channel only searches engineering documents, #product channel only searches product documents. Test edge cases like unmapped channels and direct messages.

# Test Strategy:
Channel-specific filtering works correctly, no cross-contamination between channels, unmapped channels have appropriate default behavior, DM behavior matches expectations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Test Queries in Mapped Channels [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and execute tests to verify that queries function correctly in channels that are mapped for query handling.
### Details:
Include both typical and edge-case queries. Ensure mapped channels are correctly identified and responses are as expected.

## 2. Test Queries in Unmapped Channels [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Validate that queries in unmapped channels are handled appropriately, ensuring no unintended processing or leakage.
### Details:
Attempt queries in channels not mapped for query handling. Confirm that queries are ignored or handled per requirements.

## 3. Test Queries in Direct Messages (DMs) [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2
### Description: Assess query handling in direct messages to ensure correct processing and privacy.
### Details:
Send queries via DMs and verify that responses are accurate and isolated from channel-based logic.

## 4. Verify Filtering and Cross-Contamination Prevention [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3
### Description: Test filtering mechanisms to ensure queries and responses do not cross between mapped, unmapped, and DM contexts.
### Details:
Intentionally attempt edge cases where queries could leak or be misrouted. Confirm that filtering rules prevent cross-contamination.
