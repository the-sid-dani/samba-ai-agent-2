# Task ID: 17
# Title: Create Model Flexibility Abstraction Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement abstraction layer for future model customization
# Details:
Create backend/onyx/utils/model_flexibility.py with EmbeddingProvider abstract base class. Implement OnyxDefaultEmbedding class wrapping current functionality. Add FutureCustomEmbedding placeholder. Create factory pattern with get_embedding_provider() function using USE_CUSTOM_EMBEDDINGS environment variable.

# Test Strategy:
Abstraction layer works with current default models, factory pattern switches correctly based on environment variable, placeholder for future models ready

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Abstraction Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the core abstraction for the system, ensuring separation of interface and implementation. Establish clear contracts using interfaces or abstract base classes to support extensibility for future models.
### Details:
Apply best practices such as consistent abstraction levels, modularity, and clear naming conventions. Document the abstraction's purpose and usage.

## 2. Implement Base and Default Classes [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Develop the base class(es) and at least one default implementation that adhere to the designed abstraction. Ensure these classes encapsulate shared logic and provide extensibility points.
### Details:
Follow SOLID principles and favor composition over inheritance where appropriate. Include documentation for each class.

## 3. Add Factory Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2
### Description: Implement a factory mechanism to instantiate the appropriate class based on configuration or runtime parameters. Ensure the factory supports easy integration of future models.
### Details:
Use design patterns such as Factory Method or Abstract Factory. Ensure the factory logic is modular and well-documented.

## 4. Integrate Environment Variable Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.3
### Description: Enable the system to select and configure models using environment variables. Ensure the factory logic reads and applies these variables correctly.
### Details:
Document the expected environment variables and their effects. Validate and handle missing or invalid configurations gracefully.

## 5. Develop and Execute Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.4
### Description: Create comprehensive tests to verify the abstraction, base/default classes, factory logic, and environment variable integration. Ensure tests cover extensibility and edge cases.
### Details:
Include unit and integration tests. Use mocks or stubs as needed to isolate components. Document test cases and expected outcomes.
