# Task ID: 5
# Title: Verify Docker Compose Services
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure all core services (API, background, database, Vespa, Redis) start correctly
# Details:
Test docker-compose.dev.yml with services: api_server (port 8080), background worker, relational_db (PostgreSQL 15.2), index (Vespa 8.277.17), cache (Redis 7.0.15), model_server (port 9000), nginx (port 3000). Verify health checks pass for all services. Check logs for any startup errors.

# Test Strategy:
Run `docker-compose ps` to verify all services running, `docker-compose logs` shows no critical errors, health endpoints return 200 status

# Subtasks:
## 1. Start All Required Services [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initiate all necessary services as part of the orchestration workflow, ensuring each service is started in the correct order and dependencies are respected.
### Details:
Use orchestration tools or scripts to start services. Monitor startup logs for immediate errors and confirm that each service reports a healthy initial state.

## 2. Perform Health Checks on Services [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Check the health status of each running service to ensure they are operational and ready for further integration.
### Details:
Utilize automated health check endpoints or monitoring tools to verify that each service is functioning as expected. Address any failed health checks before proceeding.

## 3. Review Service Logs for Errors or Warnings [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Analyze the logs generated by each service to identify any errors, warnings, or anomalies that could indicate integration or runtime issues.
### Details:
Aggregate and review logs using centralized logging solutions. Pay special attention to startup errors, failed dependencies, or unexpected behavior.

## 4. Verify Service Endpoints and Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Test and validate the exposed endpoints of each service to ensure they are accessible and returning expected results, confirming successful integration.
### Details:
Use automated or manual API tests to verify endpoint responses. Confirm that services interact correctly and that workflows function as intended.
