# Task ID: 18
# Title: Set Up Document Sets via Admin UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Research and configure document sets for different content types using Onyx admin interface
# Details:
First investigate if Onyx has built-in document set functionality as mentioned in the PRD. If available, access admin UI at http://localhost:3000/admin to create document sets: 'Engineering Docs' (Confluence ENG space + Drive Engineering folder), 'Product Docs' (Confluence PRODUCT space + Drive Product folder), 'General Docs' (all document sources). Use existing Onyx document set functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Onyx has document set capabilities, document sets created successfully via admin UI, proper document filtering works, can assign different sets to different use cases
