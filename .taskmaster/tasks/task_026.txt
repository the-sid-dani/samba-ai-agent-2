# Task ID: 26
# Title: Performance Testing and Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 25
# Priority: medium
# Description: Test system performance and optimize for target metrics
# Details:
Load test with target metrics: query latency < 3 seconds, support 50 concurrent users, handle 100K documents. Use tools like Apache Bench or Locust for load testing. Profile slow queries and optimize Vespa configuration, database queries, and caching strategies.

# Test Strategy:
System meets performance targets under load, no memory leaks or resource exhaustion, query latency consistently under 3 seconds

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Performance Goals and Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify key performance targets, such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization. Establish acceptance criteria and determine which scenarios (e.g., peak load, stress) to test.
### Details:
Consult stakeholders to clarify business requirements and translate them into measurable performance objectives.

## 2. Design Load Test Scenarios and Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Develop test cases and scripts that simulate real-world user interactions and workloads, covering normal, peak, and stress conditions.
### Details:
Use specialized load testing tools to create scripts that accurately reflect expected usage patterns.

## 3. Set Up Benchmarking and Test Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.2
### Description: Prepare a test environment that mirrors production, including hardware, software, and network configurations. Ensure all benchmarking tools are configured.
### Details:
Validate that the environment is isolated and consistent to ensure reliable benchmarking results.

## 4. Execute Load Tests and Collect Benchmark Data [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.3
### Description: Run the designed load tests, monitor system performance, and collect detailed benchmark data across all relevant metrics.
### Details:
Capture logs, resource usage, and response times for later analysis.

## 5. Profile and Analyze Performance Bottlenecks [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.4
### Description: Analyze collected data to identify system bottlenecks, using profiling tools to pinpoint issues across services and components.
### Details:
Prioritize bottlenecks based on impact and feasibility of optimization.

## 6. Optimize Configurations and Retest [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.5
### Description: Apply targeted optimizations to system configurations, code, or infrastructure. Rerun load tests to validate improvements and ensure performance targets are met.
### Details:
Iterate as needed, comparing results to initial benchmarks and acceptance criteria.
