# Task ID: 29
# Title: Prepare GCP Deployment Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 28
# Priority: low
# Description: Set up GCP infrastructure for production deployment
# Details:
Create GCP e2-standard-8 VM (8 vCPUs, 32GB RAM, 500GB SSD) with Docker pre-installed. Configure static IP, firewall rules for necessary ports (80, 443, 22), set up automated backups for data volumes. Prepare terraform scripts for future infrastructure as code.

# Test Strategy:
VM created successfully, Docker services run properly, static IP accessible, backups configured and tested, infrastructure reproducible

# Subtasks:
## 1. Provision Virtual Machine (VM) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new virtual machine in the target cloud environment, ensuring appropriate sizing, OS selection, and network placement.
### Details:
Select VM specifications (CPU, RAM, storage), choose the operating system, and assign to the correct virtual network/subnet. Ensure naming conventions and tagging for resource tracking.

## 2. Configure Firewall Rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Set up firewall rules to control inbound and outbound traffic for the VM, ensuring security and compliance.
### Details:
Define security group or firewall policies to allow only necessary ports (e.g., SSH, HTTP/HTTPS, Docker ports) and restrict unauthorized access. Document rules for audit and compliance.

## 3. Set Up Backup Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Implement backup solutions for the VM to ensure data protection and disaster recovery.
### Details:
Configure automated snapshots or backup schedules for VM disks and critical data. Verify backup integrity and retention policies.

## 4. Install and Configure Docker [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1, 29.2
### Description: Install Docker on the VM and verify its operation for containerized workloads.
### Details:
Install Docker engine, add user to Docker group, and test with a sample container. Ensure firewall rules permit Docker-related traffic if needed.

## 5. Prepare Terraform Scripts for Infrastructure as Code [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1, 29.2, 29.3, 29.4
### Description: Develop Terraform scripts to automate the provisioning and configuration of the VM, firewall, backups, and Docker installation.
### Details:
Write modular Terraform code to define resources, variables, and outputs. Include documentation and version control for future scalability and reproducibility.
