# Task ID: 6
# Title: Database Migration and Schema Verification
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Run database migrations and verify all required tables are created correctly
# Details:
Execute Onyx database migrations to create PostgreSQL schema including user accounts, connector configs, document metadata, and channel mappings tables. Verify Vespa schema for document embeddings and full-text indices. Check Redis configuration for caching and session data.

# Test Strategy:
Query database to verify all expected tables exist, run sample CRUD operations, check Vespa status endpoint, verify Redis connectivity

# Subtasks:
## 1. Run Database Migrations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Execute all pending migrations to update the PostgreSQL schema and any other relevant data stores to the latest version.
### Details:
Ensure migration scripts are applied in the correct order and monitor for errors or conflicts during execution.

## 2. Verify PostgreSQL Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Check that the PostgreSQL schema matches the expected structure after migrations.
### Details:
Review tables, columns, indexes, constraints, and permissions. Confirm schema organization, ownership, and adherence to best practices such as normalization and foreign key relationships[1][4][5].

## 3. Check Vespa Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Validate that the Vespa schema is up-to-date and consistent with application requirements.
### Details:
Inspect Vespa document types, fields, and schema definitions. Ensure any changes from migrations are reflected in Vespa's configuration.

## 4. Validate Redis Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Confirm that Redis configuration aligns with application needs and is compatible with recent schema or data changes.
### Details:
Check Redis key patterns, data structures, and any relevant configuration parameters. Ensure no breaking changes have been introduced.

## 5. Cross-System Consistency Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Perform end-to-end checks to ensure all data stores (PostgreSQL, Vespa, Redis) are consistent and integrated correctly after migrations.
### Details:
Run integration tests and data validation scripts to verify that all systems interact as expected and that schema changes are reflected across the stack.
