# Task ID: 28
# Title: Security Configuration and Hardening
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement security best practices and hardening measures
# Details:
Configure HTTPS/TLS for all external connections, implement proper secret management (avoid hardcoded secrets), set up network security (firewall rules, VPC if using cloud), configure authentication and authorization properly, implement rate limiting for API endpoints.

# Test Strategy:
Security scan shows no critical vulnerabilities, secrets properly managed, network access properly restricted, rate limiting prevents abuse

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure HTTPS/TLS [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up HTTPS/TLS to secure data in transit between clients and services, including certificate management and enforcing strong encryption protocols.
### Details:
Obtain and install valid TLS certificates, configure web servers or load balancers to enforce HTTPS, disable insecure protocols and ciphers, and ensure certificate renewal processes are in place.

## 2. Implement Secret Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Establish a centralized secrets management solution to securely store, access, and rotate sensitive credentials such as API keys, passwords, and certificates.
### Details:
Inventory all secrets, avoid hardcoding, automate rotation, enforce access controls, and audit secret usage. Use tools like Vault or cloud-native secret managers and maintain metadata for each secret.

## 3. Harden Network Security [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Apply network security controls to restrict unauthorized access and protect internal resources.
### Details:
Implement firewalls, network segmentation, and security groups. Restrict inbound and outbound traffic to only necessary services and monitor for suspicious activity.

## 4. Configure Authentication Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.1, 28.2
### Description: Set up robust authentication methods to verify user and service identities.
### Details:
Implement multi-factor authentication, use secure identity providers, and ensure authentication tokens are securely managed and validated.

## 5. Define and Enforce Authorization Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.4
### Description: Establish and enforce authorization rules to control access to resources based on user roles and permissions.
### Details:
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC), regularly review permissions, and audit access logs for compliance.

## 6. Implement Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.3, 28.4
### Description: Set up rate limiting to prevent abuse and mitigate denial-of-service attacks.
### Details:
Configure rate limiting at the API gateway or application layer, define thresholds per user or IP, and monitor for excessive requests.
