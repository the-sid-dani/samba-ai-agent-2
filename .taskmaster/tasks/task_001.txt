# Task ID: 1
# Title: Fork Onyx Repository and Initial Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Fork Onyx v0.29.1 repository and set up basic project structure with minimal rebranding
# Details:
Fork the Onyx v0.29.1 repository to create sambaai repository. Keep all internal structure intact including package names (onyx.*), Docker service names, database schemas, and API routes. Only change user-visible elements. Use git to fork: `git clone https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer.git sambaai && cd sambaai && git remote rename origin upstream && git remote add origin <new-repo-url>`

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository structure matches Onyx, all internal references preserved, and basic Docker compose can start without errors

# Subtasks:
## 1. Fork the Repository [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a fork of the original repository under your own account to establish an independent copy for customization.

After cloning, rename the default 'origin' remote to your fork and add the original repository as 'upstream' for future updates.

## 3. Verify Internal Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Check the internal structure of the forked repository to ensure all necessary files and directories are present and correctly organized.
### Details:
Review the repository for essential files such as Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and application source code. Confirm that the structure matches the original and supports Docker-based workflows.

## 4. Test Docker Compose Startup [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Run Docker Compose to verify that the application starts up correctly using the forked repository.
### Details:
Use 'docker-compose up' to start the application and check for successful service initialization and absence of errors.
