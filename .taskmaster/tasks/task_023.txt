# Task ID: 23
# Title: Set Up Basic Logging and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure structured logging and basic monitoring for all services
# Details:
Configure structured JSON logging for all services with appropriate log levels. Set up log rotation and retention policies. Add basic metrics collection for query latency, error rates, and service health. Use Docker logging drivers for centralized log collection.

# Test Strategy:
Logs are properly structured and collected, log rotation works, basic metrics available, can troubleshoot issues using logs

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Structured Logging Across Services [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement structured logging in all services using a consistent format (e.g., JSON), ensuring inclusion of relevant metadata such as timestamps, log levels, and context-specific fields.
### Details:
Follow best practices for structured logging, including using standard log levels, unique keys, and consistent field names. Test and validate logs before production deployment.[1][2][5]

## 2. Set Up Log Rotation Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Establish log rotation mechanisms to manage log file sizes and retention, preventing disk space issues and ensuring compliance with data retention policies.
### Details:
Configure log rotation tools (e.g., logrotate or built-in logging library features) to archive, compress, and delete old logs as needed. Ensure rotation settings are consistent across all services.

## 3. Integrate Metrics Collection [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Add metrics collection to monitor logging performance, error rates, and system health, enabling proactive alerting and observability.
### Details:
Instrument services to expose metrics (e.g., via Prometheus exporters) for log volume, error counts, and critical events. Set up dashboards and alerts for key metrics.

## 4. Integrate Docker Logging Drivers [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Configure Docker containers to use appropriate logging drivers that support structured logging and centralized log aggregation.
### Details:
Select and configure Docker logging drivers (e.g., json-file, fluentd, or syslog) to ensure logs are captured in structured format and forwarded to log management systems.

## 5. Validate and Test End-to-End Logging and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2, 23.3, 23.4
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing to ensure structured logs, log rotation, metrics, and Docker logging integration work seamlessly across all services.
### Details:
Simulate log generation, rotation, and metric collection. Verify logs are correctly formatted, rotated, and aggregated. Confirm metrics and alerts function as expected.
