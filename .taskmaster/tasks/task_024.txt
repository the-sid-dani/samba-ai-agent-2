# Task ID: 24
# Title: Create Deployment Scripts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop scripts for easy deployment and service management
# Details:
Create scripts/deploy.sh for production deployment, scripts/backup.sh for data backup, scripts/restore.sh for data restoration. Include environment validation, service health checks, and rollback procedures. Make scripts idempotent and error-resistant.

# Test Strategy:
Deployment script successfully deploys to clean environment, backup/restore scripts work correctly, rollback procedure tested

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Deployment, Backup, and Restore Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create scripts to automate deployment, backup, and restore processes, ensuring proper error handling, logging, and idempotency.
### Details:
Scripts should include steps for installing dependencies, building the application, running migrations, restarting services, creating backups before deployment, and restoring from backups if needed. Follow best practices such as meaningful logging, cleanup procedures, and versioning.

## 2. Add Environment Validation to Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Implement environment validation checks within the scripts to ensure correct environment variables and configurations are present before execution.
### Details:
Scripts should verify the presence and correctness of required environment variables and configurations, and abort execution with clear error messages if validation fails. This prevents accidental deployments or restores in the wrong environment.

## 3. Test Backup and Restore Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2
### Description: Test the backup and restore scripts in a staging environment to confirm they work as intended and data integrity is maintained.
### Details:
Perform backup and restore operations, verify that backups are created correctly, and ensure that restoring from backup returns the system to the expected state. Document any issues and refine scripts as needed.

## 4. Test and Document Rollback Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.3
### Description: Simulate deployment failures and test rollback procedures to ensure the system can recover gracefully using the backup and restore scripts.
### Details:
Intentionally trigger deployment errors, observe rollback execution, and verify that the application is restored to its previous state. Document the rollback process and update scripts or procedures based on findings.
